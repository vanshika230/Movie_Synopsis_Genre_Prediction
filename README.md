# Movie_Synopsis_Genre_Prediction
## Introduction
Public movie databases like IMDB offer genre information to aid in searching for movies. However, the process of tagging movies with genres is still manual and relies on collecting suggestions from users through designated email addresses provided by the database. This manual approach can lead to movies being registered with inaccurate genres.

To address this issue, automatic genre classification of movies based on their synopses can be employed. This automated approach not only accelerates the classification process by providing a list of suggestions but also has the potential to produce more accurate results compared to an untrained human.

## Data
The data used for this purpose has been obtained from the Radix challenge Kaggle dataset, which can be accessed at the following link: https://gitlab.com/radix-ai/challenge
